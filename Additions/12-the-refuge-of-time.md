# PFS 4-12 The Refuge of Time

_This conversion is meant to be used as an adventure for characters in the Shattered Star adventure path.  It is targeted at a party of 5 level 11 characters._

## Getting Started

_Since we established Ollysta Zadrian as the PCs point of contact in Kaer Maga we can have her give the briefing rather than the letter from Sheila and Allira Vandane._

## Act One: Accessing the Shrine

* If you want to have some encounters on the journey to the shrine here are some options:
    * 5 [Magma Scorpions](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=658)
    * Emberstorm + a single [Elemental Inferno](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=191)
    * A [Purple Worm](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=73)
    * An [Adult Red Dragon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=137)
    * 10 Sklar-Quah Burn Riders on horseback (Use [Hunter](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=907))
* **1. Valley Entrance (Moderate 11)**
    * Elite [Monadic Deva](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=543)
    * As long as they are not aggressive and put down their weapons the deva will allow players to try to convince him that they are not tomb robbers.  He requests each character remove all their magic items and questions each of them on their motives. Each character makes a diplomacy check if they are truthful or a deception check if they are lying or try to conceal their magic items against DC30.  A character who the deva detects as evil has a -2 circumstance penalty to this role.
        * Diplomacy
            * **Critical Success** +2 points
            * **Success** +1 point
            * **Failure** +0 points
            * **Critical Failure** -1 point
        * Deception
            * **Critical Success** +2 points
            * **Success** +1 point
            * **Failure** -1 point
            * **Critical Failure** -2 points
        * Intimidation
            * **Any** -1 point
        * Results
            * **5+ points** “You are true noble souls”, The deva allows the party to pass and gives them all his treasure
            * **3 to 4 points** “Seranrae’s light shines upon you” The deva allows the party to pass and gives them his mace
            * **1 to 2 points** “I thank you for your honesty” The deva allows the party to pass
            * **-1 to 0 points** “I do not believe your intentions are pure, but you may pass if you best me in honorable combat.” The deva does not allow the party to pass, but allows them to retrieve their items for an “honorable combat” if they persist.
            * **-2 or worse** “Foul deceitful wretches” The deva attacks immediately
    * **Treasure:** +1 Striking [Holy](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=299) Mace, 500gp in gemstones

## Act Two: Delving the Shrine

* **2. Entry Hall**
    * The Shoanti are still charmed and will not help the PCs.
    * Jeor Haywood and Wattlee Battlesworth both start at Indifferent and can be made friendly with a DC28 diplomacy check.
        * Jeor starts out Unfriendly if he is not referred to as Marquis after he introduces himself.  Players gain a +2 circumstance bonus on diplomacy checks if they clean his clothes and give him food.
        * Players gain a +2 circumstance bonus on diplomacy checks if they compliment Wattlee’s hair or talk to her about the construction of the shrine.
        * If either character is made friendly they will tell the players what they know about Naroth.
* **3. Flagellation Room (Trivial 11)**
    * [Seething Spirit](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1290)
* **4. Narthex**
    * **Hazard:** Touching the statue casts a random spell on a character.  Each spell is cast with DC28 and cast at 6th level
        * 1 - Envy, [Stoneskin](http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=312)
        * 2 - Sloth, [Blink](http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=27)
        * 3 - Lust, [Heroism](http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=149)
        * 4 - Wrath, [Flame Strike](http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=120)
        * 5 - Pride, [Phantasmal Killer](http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=219)
        * 6 - Gluttony, [Harm](http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=146)
        * 7 - Pride, [Righteous Might](http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=263)
        * The hazard can be destroyed with a counteract check (DC28, 6th level)
        * Anyone who receives a boon from the hazard gains a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls against Emketta.
    * **Treasure:** +1 Striking [Conducting](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=919) Whip, [Quill of Passage](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=881)
* **5. Chapel (Moderate 11)**
    * [Emketta](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/rXOCxFRT)
    * “Opponents of the faith are not permitted within this sacred site. Sheathe your weapons and prove your obedience or meet your fate!”
    * Like the deva above, players can talk their way past Emketta by convincing her they are followers of Lissala. Each player must make a DC32 Diplomacy or Deception check to do so and players who don’t display some sort of proof of their allegiance to Lissala (Lissalan cultist robes, a sihedron brand, etc.) are at a -2 circumstance penalty, and players who do not speak to her in Thassilonian are at a -2 circumstance penalty.  These penalties are cumulative.
        * Results
            * **3+ points** “Obedience is life” Emketta allows the party to pass
            * **0 to 2 points** “Obedience brings victory” Emketta prepares for combat, but allows the PCs to do the same.
            * **-1 or worse** “Your fate is sealed!” Emketta attacks immediately
    * **Treasure:** +1 Resilient Full Plate (see [graveknight’s curse](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=244)), +2 Striking [Frost](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=296) Greatsword
* **6. Inner Sanctum (Severe 11)**
    * Naroth Balam (Use Elite [Tempest-Sun Mage](http://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=972))
    * [Slothspawn Cultist](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/mwX3JRF2-slothspawn-cultist) (4)
    * **Treasure:** Greater [Staff of Conjuration](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=352), Greater [Choker of Elocution](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=422) (Thassilonian, Azlanti, and Aklo) emblazoned with a sihedron rune, +1 Striking longspear (4), Greater [Healing Potion](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=186), [Potion of Flying](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=189), [Planar Binding](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rituals.aspx?ID=17) ritual
