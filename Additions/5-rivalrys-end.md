* **A2. Swindlers at Work**
    * DC22 Perception to notice the swindlers in the cellar.
    * DC28 (Expert) Perception to find the secret door.  +4 and only requires trained since the PCs have instructions.

    * [Lock (Average)](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=30) on door.
    * DC23 (Expert) Perception to notice the secret door.
    * **Treasure: **[Disguise Kit](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=19) (4), [Thieves’ Tools](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=58) (2), [Ghost Ink](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=696)
* **B4. Reception Room (Moderate 4)**

* **B5. Trapped Room (Trivial 4)**
    * DC23 (Expert) Perception to notice the trap
    * If tripped, the entire room is covered in [Web](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=374) (DC 20) and 4 [spider swarms](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=385) pour forth.
* **B6. The Spider’s Webworks**
    * **Hazard: **Empowered Touch of Idiocy Trap (Replace with [Hallucination Powder](https://2e.aonprd.com/Hazards.aspx?ID=8) trap on door to B7 targeting everyone in B6).
* **B7. Ouidda’s Chamber (Severe 4)**
    * _This map is very cramped especially since I am adding 2 more enemies compared to the original.  Consider having the cultists attack from the stairs in B6 so that B6 remains a part of the combat area._
    * Dorianna Ouidda (Use [Cult Leader](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=930), change staff to rapier, reduce spell slots/level by 1, but add [inspire courage](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=386) and [dirge of doom](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=382))
    * Add 2 [Cultists](https://2e.aonprd.com/NPCs.aspx?ID=927)
    * **Treasure: **+1 Rapier, [Healing Potion (Lesser)](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=186), [Invisibility Potion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=187), gold inkstand, engraved hourglass, and fine paper worth a total of 25 gp.  In addition there are some journals written entirely in code.  Deciphering these would take far too long for the party, but the Pathfinder Society will give the PCs 50 gp for them.  

### C. Grandmaster Torch Strikes

_Since I’m running this as part of the Shattered Star adventure path I am re-writing this section to remove Grandmaster Torch’s betrayal and instead include some foreshadowing of the Cult of Lissala that will become more prominent later._

The scene begins as described.  At the point where Dorianna Ouidda would whisper something in Torch’s ear she instead whispers into the ear of one of his bodyguards.  At that moment 5 Lissalan Cultists (Use Elite Cultists) burst into the room.<br>
Have Torch and all of his bodyguards go after all PCs and cultists.  The first bodyguard to go is the one whom Dorianna whispered to.  He says “I am of service to fate” in Ancient Thassilonian and then decapitates Dorianna.  He proceeds to attack Torch and the other two bodyguards (this can just be described on the side while the PCs fight the cultists).  Torch and the bodyguards are able to kill the betrayer with some injuries.<br>
After the battle, searching the bodies reveals holy symbols of Lissala (DC20 religion to identify) on each of the cultists and the bodyguard.  Each of the cultists bodies are heavily tattooed with thassilonian symbols with the symbol of Envy being prominent on each of them.<br>
If anyone understands Ancient Thassilon a DC23 (Expert) Religion check can tell them “I am of service to fate” is a prayer to Lissala.

## Conclusion

Guaril Karela and Torch make arrangements for the PCs to return to Magnimar.  Sheila Heidmarch is disturbed to hear about the increased activity of the Cult of Lissala.
