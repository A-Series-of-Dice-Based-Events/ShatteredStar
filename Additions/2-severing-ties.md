# PFS 4-07 Severing Ties

_This conversion is meant to be used as an adventure for characters in the Shattered Star adventure path.  As such, it will be targeted at level one characters and will be omitting any faction missions.  Like the original version, this is intended for 6 players.  I’ve tried to keep things as close to the original as possible so that the scaling for 4 players can still be used.  Since I’ll be using this as part of an adventure path I’ve also noted treasure in certain places._
