# PFS 4-01 Rise of the Goblin Guild

_This conversion is meant to be used as a first adventure for characters in the Shattered Star adventure path.  As such, it will be targeted at level one characters and will be omitting any faction missions.  Like the original version, this is intended for 6 players.  I’ve tried to keep things as close to the original as possible so that the scaling for 4 players can still be used.  Since I’ll be using this as part of an adventure path I’ve also noted treasure in certain places._


## Catch That Goblin!

**Ekkie** ([Goblin Commando](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=233)); replace horsechopper with dogslicer, increase HP to 25.<br>
If Ekkie takes 10 or more damage, or fails to escape a grapple she surrenders.

### Chase

_I’ve modified the chase slightly so that it is linear.  House downstairs and house outside have been abstracted into additional chase points required from house upstairs if players choose to go that way._

All obstacles require chase points equal to the number of players unless otherwise noted.<br>
Players start in House Upstairs.<br>
Ekkie starts at Manner Outer Wall and moves one square per turn unless otherwise noted.<br>
If any players have actions left when they are in the same square as Ekkie they initiate combat.<br>

* **House Upstairs**
    * Climb down the wall (Athletics DC 20)
    * Run downstairs (Acrobatics DC 5 to avoid furniture) requires 2 chase points per player to move on.
* **Manner Outer Wall**
    * Squeeze through a crack (Acrobatics DC15)
    * Climb the wall (Athletics DC15)
* **Busy Street**
    * Push through (Athletics DC15)
    * Go with the flow (Society DC13)
    * Out of my Way! (Intimidate DC14)
* **Rearing Horse**
    * Ekkie cowers in fear of the horse here for one round before moving on.  If she is encountered here she begins combat with the Frightened 1 condition.
    * Calm the horse (Nature DC13)
    * Dart by (Acrobatics DC15)
* **City Watch Patrol**
    * Sneak by (Stealth DC15)
    * Butter up the sergeant (Diplomacy or Deception DC12)
* **Nightsoil Alley**
    * Disable the lock (Thievery DC15)
    * Force open the Grate (Strength DC15)
* **Sewers**
    * Ekkie escapes if she arrives here before the players. Players can make a DC15 Survival check to track her through the sewers to the Nightsoil Marauders’ Headquarters.  Each check takes 1 hour.
