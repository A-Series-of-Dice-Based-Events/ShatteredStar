# PFS 4-06 The Green Market

_This conversion is meant to be used as an adventure for characters in the Shattered Star adventure path.  It is targeted at a party of 5 level 9 characters. For most PFS scenarios that I’ve converted I have ignored the faction missions, however with this scenario the Silver Lodge faction mission gives some context to the other Cult of Lissala PFS scenarios, so you may want to give that mission to your players._

## Getting Started

_Give the players the Silver Faction mission (or a paraphrase of it) in addition to the normal mission briefing to tie into the Cult of Lissala missions. In addition I used the [Pink Rhomboid Aeon Stone](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=407), required to suppress the curse on the Shard of Gluttony, as the hook for this mission._
