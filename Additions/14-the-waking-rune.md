# PFS 4-26 The Waking Rune

_This conversion is meant for a party of 5 level 13 characters._

### Getting Started

_In my game I went straight from Words of the Ancients to this, so it was convenient for the party to be teleported to Magnimar from Kaer Maga to begin the adventure._

**Treasure:** I had the society give each character a Moderate [Potion of Resistance](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=192) and a Greater [Healing Potion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=186) instead of the equipment listed.

## A. The Sanctum of Sloth

* **A1. Breaching the Sanctum (Moderate 13)**
    * Kurshu the Undying (Use Elite [Gylou](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=610)) change tentacle abilities to use wings instead. Replace climb speed with fly speed.
    * **Hazard:** Curse of the Unfaithful
        * Stealth +22
        * The curse can be dispelled with dispel magic (level 8, DC34) otherwise it targets each creature with [Canticle of Everlasting Grief](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=879) (DC34) when they arrive. Saves are 1 step better for any character bearing a symbol of devotion to Lissala (such the Sihedron brands from earlier adventures or displaying a holy symbol of Lissala).
    * **Development:** At this point the PCs should know that they are on the clock. A DC 27 Arcana (or DC29 with other spellcasting skill) is enough to tell them they have a time limit of “an hour or so”, with a critical success telling the party they have 90 minutes. On a failure the PCs notice clues (the complex begins shaking slightly, there is a feeling of power in the air, etc.) that something is charging up.
    * For 4 players remove the hazard.
* **A2. The Conduit Door (Trivial 13)**
    * **Hazard:** Krune Feeder Trap
        * Touching the door triggers a [Vampiric Touch](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=354) (Level 7, DC34). A sihedron brand or similar adornment makes the wearer immune to this effect. Each 5 damage done this way reduces the 90 minute timer by 1 minute.
* **A3. The Waking Runes (Moderate 13)**
    * Each rune can be identified using Identify Magic DC30 (expert) using any spellcasting skill. Each rune has a specific skill that is more appropriate and reduces the DC by 2. Successfully identifying a rune reveals the ritual necessary to destroy the rune and gives a hint as to which effects are best while a critical success gives precise details. A failure only identifies the type of rune.
    * Destroying a rune is done in two parts. First a ritual is performed to remove the protective magics from the rune. This takes 5 minutes, requires 1 primary caster and 1 secondary caster and is DC32 (expert) for the primary and DC27 for the secondary in any spellcasting skill. Each of these DCs is reduced by 2 for the appropriate spellcasting skill. A failure on the ritual has no penalty, but a critical failure subjects both casters to the [Curse of Sloth](https://template.pf2.tools/v/Tr4Mm0w7-curse-of-sloth).
    * After the protective magics have been stripped from a rune it can be destroyed with appropriate spells/effects or by damaging the rune with physical or magical attacks. Either the primary or secondary caster must continue to perform the ritual during this step, but no longer has to make any checks to hold the protective magics at bay. Using an appropriate effect during this step instantly destroys the rune and the attacker suffers no consequences. Each use of an inappropriate attack/effect against a rune deals damage to it as normal, but subjects the attacker to the _Curse of Sloth_.
    * Each runes base statistics are:
        * HP 50, Hardness 15
        * Fort +21, Will +21, Auto fails (not crit fails) Ref saves.
        * Normal item immunities except where noted.
    * **A3a. Rune of Life**
        * Appropriate Skill: Nature or Religion
        * Appropriate Effects: Forces of death - Spells of 4th level or higher that deal negative damage, or that apply the enfeebled, clumsy, drained, stupefied or doomed conditions or that have the death trait.
    * **A3b. Rune of Alacrity**

        * Appropriate Effects: Effects that impede speed and mobility - Spells of 4th level or higher that deal cold damage or apply the slowed, stunned, immobilized, paralyzed or restrained conditions.
    * **A3c. Rune of Defense**
        * Appropriate Skill: Arcana or Occult
        * Appropriate Effects: Effects that batter and shock - Spells of 4th level or higher that deal electricity, force, or sonic damage, a 4th level or higher dispel magic, or a single blow from a bludgeoning weapon or adamantine weapon of 8th level or higher.
    * **A3d. Rune of Life**
        * **Treasure:** +2 Greater Striking Adamantine Flail
    * **A3e. Rune of Armor**
        * Appropriate Skill: Religion or Arcana
        * Appropriate Effects: Effects that scorch, sabotage, or find weak points - Spells of 4th level or higher that deal acid or fire damage, two successful DC30 thievery checks, or a single blow from a weapon of 8th level or higher with the deadly or fatal traits.
    * **A3f. Rune of Control**
        * Appropriate Skill: Arcana or Occult
        * Appropriate Effects: Servant creatures and powerful commands - 4th level Command, Dominate, or other similar spells of 4th level or higher that command a creature’s actions or a single strike from a creature summoned by a summon spell of 4th level or higher.
    * **A3g. Rune of Life**
    * **What if time expires?**
        * If the party has not disabled all of the runes by the time 90 minutes has expired the Lashmistress completes her ritual and the remaining runes begin to glow and are encased in magical energy. They have now re-attached to the runes on Krune’s body and can not be destroyed while he still lives.
* **A4. The Lashmistress (Moderate 13)**
    * Vandiana the Lashmistress (Use [Xulgath Deepmouth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=881))

        * Add Battle Cry feat, and Reach Spell feat, whip, and +22 athletics skill
    * Agarik and Jorgas (Use [Norgorberite Poisoner](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=10308&name=norgorberite_poisoner))
    * Dark Naga (Use [Guardian Naga](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=307))
    * **Hazard:** Glyph of Warding
        * Stealth DC30 (expert), disable Arcana DC30 (other spellcasting DC32)

    * For 4 players remove 1 of the poisoners.
* **A5. The Innermost Sanctum (Severe+ 13)**
    * _After defeating the combatants in A4 the party should have a single 10 minute period to rest before Krune rises._
    * [Runelord Krune](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/oXLbJZzB)
        * Each rune from A3 that was not disabled increases Krune’s power
        * Rune of Alacrity - Krune gains +2 on initiative rolls and is under a constant [haste](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=147) effect.
        * Rune of Armor - Krune gains a +2 status bonus to AC. When using the [Shield](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=280) Cantrip it grants a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and the 10 minute cooldown after using the shield block reaction is removed.
        * Rune of Control - Any creatures summoned by Krune gain the Elite adjustment. His Runelord’s Dominion ability affects all creatures in a 10 foot square instead of a single creature.
        * Rune of Defense - Krune gains resistance 10 to physical damage.
        * Rune of Life - Each gives Krune an additional 20 HP and increases his fast healing by 10.
    * **Hazard:** Anyone who ends their turn in the mist surrounding the sarcophagus must make a DC32 Fort save or be slowed 1 for 1 round. A critical success makes them immune to this effect. Krune is immune to this effect as are any creatures he summons.
    * **Treasure:** [Staff of Conjuration](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=352) (Major), Tourmaline Sphere [Aeon Stone](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=407)
