# PFS 4-20 Words of the Ancients

_This conversion is meant for a party of 4 level 12 characters._

## Getting Started

_Since we established Ollysta Zadrian as the PCs point of contact in Kaer Maga we can have her give the briefing._

## A. Desgard’s Thousand Columns

To cast a teleportation spell in this area a caster must make a DC32 counteract check or the spell is lost. When casting a summoning spell a random creature is pulled from one of the towers as described.

* **A2. The Jaded Sentinel (Low 12)**
    * [Zonaladin](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/bmY5DWX7)
        * Zonaladin is enfeebled 2, drained 2 and fatigued. He only has 210 hp remaining and has cast all of his 5th and 6th level spells except for tongues and teleport. This reduces him to a low threat encounter.
    * To convince Zonaladin to let them pass the party may attempt the listed tasks. The DCs are as follows: Easy 28, Moderate 30, Hard 32, Impossible 35. In addition to the normal success and fail effects, a critical failure increases suspicion by 2 points, and a critical success decreases suspicion by a point and convinces Zonaladin to give the party a reward (listed below).
    * **Treasure:** [Greater Holy Prayer Beads](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=256), Scroll of [Divine Wrath](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=86) (5th) If Zonaladin is defeated and his lair searched he also has 12 emeralds worth 50gp each.
    * For 5 players give Zonaladin the elite adjustment and add a scroll of [heal](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=148) (5th).

## B. The Thousandth Spire

* **B1. Hall of Memories (Low 12)**
    * Elite [Hound of Tindalos](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=702) (6)
    * For 5 players add 1 more Hound of Tindalos
* **B3. Path of the Primes**
    * Characters can get clues with DC30 Arcana checks (DC32 with other spellcasting skills)
        * Hidden now by factors few - The teleportation seems to take you to a floor based on the number of factors of the tick marks.
        * Twice I strode - Need to do the same thing twice
        * Obscure the one by primal sight - Go through a prime number

## C. Runevault

* **C1. A Riddle in Scales (Moderate 12)**
    * Elite [Imentesh](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=766) (3)
    * **Treasure:** Book collection worth 200gp.
    * For 5 players add 1 more Imentesh and increase the value of the book collection to 300gp.
* **C2. The Unlikely Prisoner**
    * _This trap didn’t seem that interesting so I skipped it._
* **C3. The False Plates**
    * A DC30 Arcana (or other spellcasting) check can reveal that the transmutation aura of the rune plates seems odd.
    * A character who speaks Thassilonian can make a DC35 Society check to recognize that the runes are atypical for a native thassilonian speaker.
    * A DC17 strength check can bend the plates.
    * **Treasure:** Greater [Doubling Rings](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=432), 200gp in emeralds, 300gp in diamonds, 300gp
    * For 5 players add a Greater [Thunderbird Tuft](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1011)
* **C4. The True Plates**
    * **Treasure:** [Sihedron Brand (Service)](https://template.pf2.tools/v/rpmsb186-sihedron-brand-service), Rune Plates

## Aftermath

* **The Sleepers Stir (Low 12)**
    * [Animate Dreams](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=546) (6)
* **Growing Suspicions (Moderate 12)**
    * If he had at least 3 suspicion points Zonaladin has healed himself and removed his negative conditions by the time the party gets back.
