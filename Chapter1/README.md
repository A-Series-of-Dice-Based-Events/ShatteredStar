# Shards of Sin
_This is a conversion of the Adventure Path Shards of Sin (Shattered Star Book 1) to Pathfinder 2nd edition.  This is intended to be a faithful conversion from the original meant for 4 players.  Since I am running this for 5 players I will also note potential additions for 5 players. Expected level up points are noted and threat level of encounters are relative to those expected levels.  However, I use milestone leveling, so specific XP values are not given. At the time this conversion was made the only official monster stats that were available were from Bestiary 1 & 2 and the Gamemastery Guide.  In the future you may want to use official stats for monsters that have since been published._
_In addition to the adventure path itself I will be adding several “Additions” which are mostly modules taken from season 4 of Pathfinder Society that are intended to enhance the adventure path. These conversions will be kept in separate documents so that this conversion is faithful to the original adventure, but the places where I would add the content is noted._

The Aspis consortium is a nice foil to the Pathfinder Society and can be played up as an ongoing antagonist if you desire; perhaps even adding a party of Consortium agents that is also after the shards.

## Level 4

#### [Addition 5: PFS 4-23 - Rivalry’s End](../Additions/5-rivalrys-end.md)

_This wraps up the story arc of The Spider and her role in the Aspis Consortium started with Addition 2.  This can occur any time in this section of the adventure if your players need a break from dungeon crawling, or after they have found the second shard.  You likely want to modify the ending of this module, since the PFS Shadow Lodge plotline isn’t important to this adventure path.  My recommendation is to have a tie in to the Cult of Lissala to tie into higher level PFS scenarios that can be run as additions to later books of this AP._<br>
