# Into the Nightmare Rift

_This is a conversion of the Adventure Path Beyond the Doomsday Door (Shattered Star Book 5) to Pathfinder 2nd edition.  This is intended to be a conversion from the original adventure meant for 4 players.  Since I am running this for 5 players I will also note potential additions for 5 players._
_Expected level up points are noted and threat level of encounters are relative to those expected levels.  However, I use milestone leveling, so specific XP values are not given._
_Since I am already converting the entire adventure path I am trying to make it cover the entire leveling range from 1-20. For this module, that means that it will be covering levels 16-18, with the characters just entering level 19 at the completion of the module._

_Note, since the characters are now several levels above where they were in the original adventure we will often have to increase the levels of the creatures in the adventure. Rather than list the full stats for these creatures I will list these as Advanced 'creature' (Level x) where x is the level the creature has been increased to. You can use a digital tool to advance the stats and abilities of these creatures, or reference the creature building benchmarks in the game mastery guide to figure out what the new creature stats should be._
