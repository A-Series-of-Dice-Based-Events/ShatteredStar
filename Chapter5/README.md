# Into the Nightmare Rift

*This is a conversion of the Adventure Path Beyond the Doomsday Door (Shattered Star Book 5) to Pathfinder 2nd edition.  This is intended to be a conversion from the original adventure meant for 4 players.  Since I am running this for 5 players I will also note potential additions for 5 players.*
*Expected level up points are noted and threat level of encounters are relative to those expected levels.  However, I use milestone leveling, so specific XP values are not given.*
*Since I am already converting the entire adventure path I am trying to make it cover the entire leveling range from 1-20. For this module, that means that it will be covering levels 16-18, with the characters just entering level 19 at the completion of the module.*

*Note, since the characters are now several levels above where they were in the original adventure we will often have to increase the levels of the creatures in the adventure. Rather than list the full stats for these creatures I will list these as Advanced 'creature' (Level x) where x is the level the creature has been increased to. You can use a digital tool to advance the stats and abilities of these creatures, or reference the creature building benchmarks in the game mastery guide to figure out what the new creature stats should be.*

## Level 16

### Part One: Giants of Wrath

*Researching Guiltspur gives information at the listed DCs with a society check or a relevent lore. Cadrilkasta can be researched using Arcana or a relevent lore.

First a dose of [abysium powder](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1407) from **E5** must be strewn into the fountain and then a [nightmare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=208) or [plane shift](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=222) spell must be cast on the fountain. A creature must then immerse itself in the fountain's water and then jump into the mist. If the spells are not available, the water from the fountain can instead be poured onto a creature from the [Cauldron of Nightmares](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=891) in **E9** to get the same effect. If Mesmalatu and the Abysium Reactor are both destroyed a character must only immerse themselves in the fountain water and jump into the mist.

* **E4. The Dreaming Crypt (Trivial 17)**
    * Advanced [Leng Ghoul](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1165) (Level 14)
    * The secret door can be found with a DC37 (master) perception check

* **E5. The Abysium Core (Moderate 17)**
    * **Hazard:** Each round creatures within this room or within a 60 foot cone of the open coor must make a DC35 fortitude save once per minute:
        * **Critical Success** Immune to further radiation for 10 minutes
        * **Success** Increase sickened value by 1 (maximum 2)
        * **Failure** Increase sickened value by 2 (maximum 4) and drained value by 1 (maximum 2)
        * **Critical Failure** Increase sickened value by 2 (maximum 4) and drained value by 2 (maximum 4)

    * **Hazard:** Each creature within the room is struk by lightning if they fail a DC5 flat check. On a failure they are struck by a bolt of lightning for 9d12 electricity damage with a basic DC 35 reflex save.

    * **Development:** The reactor has 3600 hp and hardness 20. Each time the pillar is struck lightning arcs to strike the creature striking it with the effects described above, but with the reflex DC increased to 37. Creatures can make an athletics check to destroy the pillar, DC65 - 1 for each 100hp it has been reduced. If destroyed the reactor explodes dealing 9d12 electricity damage with a DC37 reflex save and 12d8 sonic damage with a DC37 basic fortitude save in a 60 foot emination. If the bhole misses an attack against a creature adjacent to the reactor it makes a beak strike against the reactor and then makes an athletics check to see if it destroys the reactor, suffering the effects of striking the reactor. 

    * **Treasure:** A single interact action can grab a single dose of [abysium powder](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1407) and put it in a readied container. There are 20 doses available.

* **E6. Whisperstone Sanctum**
    * A character with trick magic item can activate the whisperstone with a DC35 arcana or occultism check without the key. A failure subjects a character to the will save described below.
    * To use the whisperstone a character must make a DC30 check with an appropriate skill to gain the knowledge they are looking for. On a failure the character must make a DC35 will save or become stupified 1 or stupified 2 on a critical failure.
    
* **E7. Binding Chamber (Trivial 17)**
    * A DC35 arcana or occultism check reveals the function of the metal grill. It reduces the DC of the [Planar Binding](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rituals.aspx?ID=17) ritual by 2, and once per week creates the binding wards on it's own, allowing the ritual to be cast without secondary casters. The secondary dipolomacy or intimidation check can either be performed by the primary caster or a secondary caster.
    * Advanced [Nalfeshnee](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=602) (Level 17)
    * Advanced [Astral Deva](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=16) (Level 17)
    * Characters can make perception checks against a DC41 deception DC to tell Beruvexus is lying.
    * Note, Beruvexus retains a Nalfeshnee's Forfeiture Aversion even in the astral deva form.

* **E9. Guiltspur Grand Hall (Severe 17)**
    * *Note: add piles of bones in the outer hall to the description. These are what the graveknight champions form from*
    * [Mesmalatu](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/tV26FVj7)
    * [Graveknight Champion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1664) (2)
        * The Graveknight champions begin as strewn bones. They reform and roll initiative when Mesmalatu leaves torpor
    * **Hazard:** [Green Slime](https://2e.aonprd.com/Hazards.aspx?ID=40)
        * Targets anyone within 5 feet of the curtain.
        * Increase reflex save to DC 35
    * **Treasure:** [Cauldron of Nightmares](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=891), [Demilich Eye Gems](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=489) (2, Maze, Polar Ray), Nightgaunt Mask (Use [Dread Blindfold](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=433)), whisperstone key (sapphire worth 2000 gp), +2 resilient fullplate (2), +1 striking [greater flaming](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=295) greapick (2), +1 striking [greater flaming](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=295) shortbow (2)
    * For 5 players give the Graveknight Champions the elite adjustment, increase the spell levels in the demilich eye gems to 9, double their value, and increase their level by 2.

## Level 18

### Part Three: Temple of the Crawling Chaos

*The temple is Severe Cold. Creatures not in cold weather gear are subject to 2d6 cold damage each hour and become fatigued after 4 hours of exploration time. In addition the air is quite thin and can quickly make characters fatigued. After any strenous activity a character must make a DC35 fortitude save or become fatigued. Strenous activities include combat encounters, skill activities based on a physical ability scores, each 10 minutes of an exploration activity, etc.*

*Note: Since altitude is not a normal hazard in pf2e there are no written ways to counter it that I could find. I allowed an Endure Elements (7th) to counter the effect of the altitude sickness (in addition to the severe cold)*

* **F1. Temple Entrance (Low 18)**
    * [Nightgaunt Troop](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/L84HFDbP-nightgaunt-troop) (2)
    * **Hazard:** **Severe Winds** At the beginning of each creature's turn they must make a DC35 Athletics check or be moved 10 feet in a random direction (20 feet on a critical failure). Creatures with a free hand can use a reaction to hold onto something solid (such as a statue) to gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their check and optionally make a Fortitude save instead of an Athletics check. Flying creatures must instead make a DC40 Maneuver in Flight check and the forced movement is doubled. Non-flying creatures that are large increase their degree of success by 1 on this check and huge or larger creatures are immune, but both are affected normally while flying. Tiny creatures reduce their degree of success by 1.
    * **Hazard:** The cliff edge can be climbed with a DC30 check. The winds impose an additional -4 circumstance penalty to climb checks. Creatures that fall off the edge of the cliff find themselves in **E3** and take damage as if they had fallen 200 feet.

* **F2. The Halls of Leng (Trivial 18)**
    * Advanced [Leng Ghoul](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1165) (Level 14) (2)

* **F3. Charnel Banquet (Moderate 18)**
    * Advanced [Leng Ghoul](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1165) (Level 14) (8)
    * The Ghouls are initial unfriendly, but a DC35 diplomacy check can change their attitude to friendly. If Morcruft accompanies the PCs give them a +5 circumstance bonus on the check.
    * For 5 players add an additional 2 ghouls.

* **F6. Bone Pit (Low 18)**
    * Advanced [Gug](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=252) (Level 14) (4)
    * Advanced [Gug](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=252) (Level 16)
        * This gug savant can cast the following innate spells at level 8 (DC34, +26) - Shape Stone, Spike Stones, Stoneskin, Transmute Rock and Mud, Pummeling Rubble, Shockwave, Scatter Scree
    * For 5 players advance the Gugs to level 15 instead.

* **F7. Mesmalatu's Phylactery (Low 18)**
    * Weak [Vazgorlu](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=493)
    * **Treasure:** brazier worth 1000gp, Thassilonian funeral robe worth 2000gp, [Headband of Inspired Wisdom](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=402), [Amber Sphere Aeon Stone](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=407)
    * For 5 players remove the weak adjustment and add a [Sun Orchid Poultice](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=763) to the treasure.

* **F9. The Great Temple to the Crawling Chaos (Moderate 18)**
    * Elite [Leng Spider](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=713) (4)
        * Reduce the spiders size to large so they fit in the room better
    * [Shoggoth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=368)
        * The shoggoth is unable to move, but may attack creatures within it's reach from the edge of the bowl.
        * When taking the engulf action, the shoggoth instead makes an athletics check against the fortitude DC of each creature it currently has grabbed. On a success it pulls creatures adjacent to the bowl and extends the grapple for another round. Creatures that are already adjacent to the bowl are instead pulled into the bowl and engulfed by the shoggoth.
        * Each creature killed while adjacent to the bowl, or while grabbed/engulfed by the shoggoth reduces the ritual time by 3 days.
    * For 5 players add an additional spider and give the Shoggoth the elite adjustment.

* **F10. The Cursed Dragon (Severe 18)**
    * Cadrilkasta (Advanced [Ancient Blue Dragon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=132) (Level 21))
        * Add the following level 9 spells: [Disjunction](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=77), [Foresight](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=127), [Summon Draconic Legion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1008)
        * Cadrilkasta may also use any abilities of the [Shard of Sloth](https://template.pf2.tools/v/8Rz9PQPo-shard-of-sloth), but also suffers from its curse.
    * **Hazard:** The same severe winds and cliff edge exist here as in **F1**. Due to her size Cadrilkasta is immune to the severe winds unless flying.
    * **Treasure:** +2 Greater Striking [Greater Flaming](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=295) Spear, [Eye of Fortune](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=435), [Titan's Grasp](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1082), [Major Energy Mutagen](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=474), [Eye of Apprehension](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=209), [Lucky Rabbit's Foot](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=568), Scroll of [Miracle](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=196), [Shard of Sloth](https://template.pf2.tools/v/8Rz9PQPo-shard-of-sloth), 10,000gp in coins and another 10,000 gp in misc treasure
    * **Development:** If Xaivanshee is with the party she immediately attempts to grab the Shard of Sloth once Cadrilkasta has been defeated. If she does so she says a quick prayer and then slits her own throat, killing herself. Give the party 10 minutes before she rises as a vampire (see **F10a** below)
    * For 5 players add an Elite [Cornugon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=611) named Xavrax whom Cadrilkasta has bound to serve as commander of her legions. Xavrax has been stuck doing menial tasks for the slothful Cadrilkasta and relishes any chance for combat. Add 5000gp, a [Dispelling Sliver](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=205) and a [Floating Shield](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=319) to the treasure.

* **F10a. Vampiric Xaivanshee (Severe 18)**
    * *After Xiavanshee kills herself with the Shard of Sloth each of her Hunt Mistresses begins a prayer to Zura over her body, not realizing it will lead to their own demise. After 10 minutes the Hunt Mistresses let out a scream as their blood is drained from their body into Xiavanshee. Xiavanshee rises as a true vampire and each of the Hunt Mistresses is instantly transformed into a Vampire Spawn.*
    * [Vampire Xiavanshee](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/lDclC4p1)
    * Advanced [Vampire Guardian](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=2149) (Level 16) (3)
    * **Treasure:** Equipment from Xiavanshee & 3 Hunt Mistresses (see **D9**)
    * For 5 players advance the Vampire Guardians to level 17
