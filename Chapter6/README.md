# The Dead Heart of Xin

*This is a conversion of the Adventure Path The Dead Heart of Xin (Shattered Star Book 6) to Pathfinder 2nd edition.  This is intended to be a conversion from the original adventure meant for 4 players.  Since I am running this for 5 players I will also note potential additions for 5 players.*
*Expected level up points are noted and threat level of encounters are relative to those expected levels.  However, I use milestone leveling, so specific XP values are not given.*
*Since I am already converting the entire adventure path I am trying to make it cover the entire leveling range from 1-20. For this module, that means that it will be covering levels 18-20. Characters are expected to be mid-way through level 18 at the beginning of the adventure and will level up to 20 part way through the adventure, so that they have some time to play at max level.*

*Note, since the characters are now several levels above where they were in the original adventure we will often have to increase the levels of the creatures in the adventure. Rather than list the full stats for these creatures I will list these as Advanced 'creature' (Level x) where x is the level the creature has been increased to. You can use a digital tool to advance the stats and abilities of these creatures, or reference the creature building benchmarks in the game mastery guide to figure out what the new creature stats should be.*

## Level 18

### Part One: The Sihedron Reborn

#### Benefits of Fame
*Begin each player with 10 fame points. If characters have feats or class features that would make them more famous increase their starting fame by 1-4 points for each feat or feature. For example, a feat like [Legendary Performer](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=805) might increase fame by 4 points, while [Entourage](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1066) might increase it by 2.*

### Part Two: Xin Rising

* **Event 1: The Earthquake (Moderate 18)**
    * Enormous Shriezyx (Use Weak [Vazgorlu](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=493))
        * Change size to huge
    * Each round each character must make a DC40 reflex save
        * **Critical Success** No effect
        * **Success** All terrain is treated as difficult terrain
        * **Failure** Fall prone
        * **Critical Failure** Fall prone and take 3d6 bashing damage
    * For 5 players remove the Weak adjustment.
    * **Treasure:** The [Sihedron](https://template.pf2.tools/v/0Dh1J8xh-sihedron) may now be claimed by the party.
    * **Development:** Once the Shriezyx has been defeated allow each character to make a DC40 perception check. On a success they notice the flurry of activity in Beacon's Point which can clue them in on the incoming tsunami. A DC35 Nature check can tell the characters that a tsunami typically follows a costal earthquake, while a critical success gives them more precise timing.

* **Event 4: Heralds of Xin (Low 18)**
    * [Clockwork Dragon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1098) (3)
    * For 5 players add a 4th dragon.

* **Event 5: Enraged Denizen (Moderate 18)**
    * The streets of Magnimar remain flooded. Small creatures must swim to move, while medium creatures treat the streets as greater difficult terrain if trying to walk on foot. The DC to swim is 25.
    * [Aureusa](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/hf9sXdBm-scylla)
    * **Treasure:** Thassilon-era gold jewelry worth 1000 gp, [Bracers of Armor III](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=416)

#### Aftermath

    * **Treasure:** Shiela gives each character a [Homeward Wayfinder](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=470)

## Level 19

### Part Three: Crystal Palace

#### Xin Island Features
* Each hour spent searching the island characters must make a DC35 Fortitude save due to the stench of decay. On a failure they are sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure) for the next hour of searching.

#### Crystal Palace General Features
* All light sources are reduced by 1 level Bright to Dim, Dim to nothing. Effects of Level 20 or higher (such as the Sihedron) ignore this.
* All walls act like opaque level 10 [Walls of Force](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=363) that regenerate 20 hp/round. The walls are immune to fire and cold damage. Sonic damage bypasses hardness, and the walls have weakness 20 sonic. Climbing the wall is DC40. 
* The walls block all types of teleportation through them although rooms that are not completely enclosed can be teleported into/out of by spells that do not require line of sight.
* Doors can be locked by Xin's spirit. Locked doors can be broken down with a DC45 athletics check, or DC45 thievery check to disable the lock.

  * The spells come from Xin's spirit, so once used can not be used by additional haunted constructs until the next day.
  * The construct can be damaged by positive or lawful damage. If it takes 30 or more positive or lawful damage in a single round Xin is temporarily ejected from the creature. It becomes stunned 1 and may not use any spellcasting from Xin's Spirit for a round.
