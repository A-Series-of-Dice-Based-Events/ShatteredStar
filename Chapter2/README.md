# Curse of the Lady’s Light

_This is a conversion of the Adventure Path Curse of the Lady’s Light (Shattered Star Book 2) to Pathfinder 2nd edition.  This is intended to be a faithful conversion from the original meant for 4 players.  Since I am running this for 5 players I will also note potential additions for 5 players._
_Expected level up points are noted and threat level of encounters are relative to those expected levels.  However, I use milestone leveling, so specific XP values are not given._
_Since I am already converting the entire adventure path I am trying to make it cover the entire leveling range from 1-20. For this module, that means that it will be covering levels 5-8, with the characters just entering level 9 at the completion of the module._
_In addition to the adventure path itself I will be adding several “Additions” that are intended to enhance the adventure path.  These conversions will be kept in separate documents so that this conversion is faithful to the original adventure, but the places where I would add the content is noted._

    * _Since a player is almost certainly going to fail the check for Phantasmal Killer you should probably just run this in a cinematic way.  The target sees Sorshen grow huge and crush him to death, while the rest of the party sees the character twitch and gasp a bit before falling dead. If you can manage to do this at the end of a session this is a really great “WTF just happened?” moment to leave your players with._
    * A character who becomes Sorshen’s clone rises as a Human with True Azlanti heritage.  A True Azlanti gains a boost to all 6 ability scores instead of just 2, but does not gain any other heritage benefits.

* **K11. Pit Trap (Trivial 7)**
    * [Spiky Pit](https://pf2.easytool.es/index.php?id=7480&name=spiky_pit)
    * _Note, this trap is really boring.  I recommend swapping it out with [Poisoned Dart Gallery](http://2e.aonprd.com/Hazards.aspx?ID=25).  This increases the threat level to Low 7._
* **K12. Battle Site (Low 7)**
    * [Incubus](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/ylmtFWZ5-incubus) (2)
    * **Treasure:** +1 Striking Scimitar (2)

    * **Treasure:** [Bracers of Armor I](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=416)
    * _This is also a good place to add some extra treasure if your party missed some._
* **K17. Preparation Room**
    * DC23 Arcana or Occult to recognize the [suggestion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=315) spell.  A critical success conveys understanding of how to use it.
* **K18. Cleansing Room**
    * DC26 Athletics to wrench open the grating.
    * DC18 (Any magic type) to recognize [dispel magic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=78).  A critical success conveys understanding of how to use it.

* **K21. Conjuration Lab (Severe 7)**
    * _There isn’t really any good replacement for the book in this room, so I’ve replaced it with another valuable item. You should add a crown to the description of the room._
    * [Fiendish Seugathi](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/HQ4Lsozh)
    * **Hazard: **Each round after the Seugathi is summoned the portal remains open summoning a random Demon through.

        * _In my game I played the additional demons that come through the portal as friendly to each other, but not the Seugathi, so they were affected by the Seugathi’s aura and the Seugathi might command them to attack each other.  This helps cut down on what can be a quite difficult fight if the portal stays open for a full 3 rounds._
    * **Treasure:** +1 Striking Flaming Longsword (wielded by the Seugathi), _From the Minds of Monsters_ ([Scholarly Journal (Compendium)](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=64) on the topic of mind affecting monsters), [Hat of the Magi (Greatrer)](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=443) in the form of a crown
