# The Asylum Stone

_This is a conversion of the Adventure Path The Asylum Stone (Shattered Star Book 3) to Pathfinder 2nd edition.  This is intended to be a conversion from the original meant for 4 players.  Since I am running this for 5 players I will also note potential additions for 5 players._
_Expected level up points are noted and threat level of encounters are relative to those expected levels.  However, I use milestone leveling, so specific XP values are not given._
_Since I am already converting the entire adventure path I am trying to make it cover the entire leveling range from 1-20. For this module, that means that it will be covering levels 9-12, with the characters just entering level 13 at the completion of the module._
_In addition to the adventure path itself I will be adding several “Additions” that are intended to enhance the adventure path.  These conversions will be kept in separate documents so that this conversion is faithful to the original adventure, but the places where I would add the content is noted._


## Level 9


#### Addition 8: PFS 4-03 The Golemworks Incident

_After being away from Magnimar for so long it’s nice to spend some time back in the city. This module also introduces the Golemworks as a major force in magnimar and continues the theme of the Aspis Consortium being a recurring antagonist of the Pathfinder Society. Conversion is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lzbnVaNNBnMU1l2Z9plNeCvAXxgHs0ZoD6uGtqMPCjs)._

_**Treasure:** [Sturdy Shield (Lesser)](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=327), Trusty Buddy (Adamantine [Levered Crowbar](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=18)), +1 Crossbow, +1 Staff, books worth 300 sp, wand of [Resist Energy](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=256) (Level 2), +1 striking composite shortbow (20 arrows), +1 rapier, [invisibility potion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=187), [giant wasp venom](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=115), [lesser darkvision elixir](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=89), Statue of Lissala worth 250 sp, 4 [Lesser Elixer of Life](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=91), [Slippers of Spider Climbing](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=465),  (+1 sickle, [moderate antidote](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=80), [moderate antiplague](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=81)) * 2, +1 crossbow, +1 resilient explorer's clothing, [moderate healing potion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=186), [staff of abjuration](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=351), [Dusty Rose Prism Aeon Stone](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=407), 100gp_


### Part One: Up a River

_Note that if you’re using the additions then the route from Magnimar is a bit different. The party takes a ship to Korvosa and then to Palin’s Cove. From Palin’s Cove they take an overland trek to Melfesh, and from there take the Lucky Jenny the rest of the way to the Halflight Path._


#### Addition 9: PFS 4-06 The Green Market

_In my game several characters are from Korvosa and the players recently finished Curse of the Crimson Throne, so re-visiting the city itself is meaningful to them.  This module has connections to both the Aspis Consortium and the Cult of Lissala, but isn’t a critical story component, so feel free to skip it if you don’t want to stop by Korvosa.  If you do skip this one you’ll want to have Sheila give the party the [Pink Rhomboid Aeon Stone](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=407) before they leave Magnimar. Conversion is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d6MAEzKA6syPaSYo9vmqnjxiPdzJcRp_eBCWJXH0dUI/)._

_**Treasure:** +1 Morningstar (4), +1 Spear, [Potion of Moderate Resistance](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=192) (2 fire), [Moderate Healing Potion](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=186) (3), [Potion of Quickness](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=191), +1 Striking Ghost Touch Staff, [Elemental Gem (Fire)](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=243), [Necklace of Fireballs III](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=449)_, _[Pink Rhomboid Aeon Stone](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=407)_


#### Addition 10: PFS 4-08 The Cultist’s Kiss

_This is the first in a 5 part series of modules in which the Cult of Lissala is the major antagonist, and which ends with the defeat of the Runelord Krune. Conversion is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T4M86iOZGcHzhfKs8w_Djob7wRgLuUuDhN9s3ug9Y9s)._

_**Treasure:** [Sihedron Brand (Endurance)](https://template.pf2.tools/v/pv8HmTRB-sihedron-brand-endurance), +1 Striking Rapier, +1 Striking Shortbow, [Elemental Wayfinder (Fire)](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=470), [Storm Arrow](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=169) (2), +1 Resilient Explorer’s Clothing (2), [Slime Whip](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=792), [Phylactery of Faithfulness](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=452) (Lissala), Scroll of [Vampiric Maiden](http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=725) (4th), Scroll of [Enervation](http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=687) (4th), 200gp_


#### Clash with the Sorebacks (Low 9)

_The original creatures in this encounter are leveled so low it didn’t really feel like it was worth converting.  I used Xulgath’s instead of Boggards because there are a lot of them available._

* [Xulgath Mage](https://pf2.easytool.es/index.php?id=5543&name=xulgath_mage)
* [Xulgath Skirmisher](https://pf2.easytool.es/index.php?id=6409&name=xulgath_skirmisher) (3)

## Level 10


### Part Two: City of Strangers


#### Addition 11: PFS 4-10 The Feast of Sigils

_Part 2 of the Cult of Lissala arc is conveniently located right in Kaer Maga.  Since we aren’t in Magnimar, Ollysta Zadrian can show up in Kaer Maga to give the mission briefing, and can be the PCs contact for future missions in this arc. Conversion is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-G2Pj74WcHIrT3uMWAotHE9UgICjkf_l5Wv5dH_q4pA)._

    * For 5 players add the Elite adjustment to the Divine Warden and add scrolls for each of the uncommon spells.


#### Returning Augustille

_If you’re using the additions you should have the players do addition 12 before doing the events back at the Augur Temple, otherwise the timeline of Part 3 doesn’t really line up.  You can have Vargun tell the PCs she has leads, but needs some time to follow up on them or something._


## Level 11


### Addition 12: PFS 4-12 The Refuge of Time

_Part 3 of the Cult of Lissala story arc has the players traveling to the Wyvern Mountains west of Kaer Maga to seek out Refuge Tokens that can teleport one to the Runelord Krune's resting place. Conversion is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DN9iSvXEpJUhuDpSh_xnMWLHIxA9BT3b20HQ0tij2I)._

#### B. The Therassic Workshop

_Note, this map is very tight, the worst offender being B11 where there are 3 creatures in a room that only has 5 full squares.  I doubled the size of the map to make the size of encounter areas more reasonable._

* **B2. Passage**
    * DC32 (master) to notice the hidden door.
* **B3. Research Assistant (Trivial 11)**
    * **Hazard:** Research Assistant 
        * Stealth DC30 (expert) to realize it’s dangerous. 
        * Can be disarmed by saying “Disarm” in Thassilonian (DC32 (expert) Arcana or Occult to discover), -2 circumstance penalty if a character doesn’t understand Thassilonian
        * If a PC triggers the trap each character in the room is targeted by a rune; each run has a DC30 save to resist, and the effect is doubled on a critical failure.
            * 1 - Fort Save, Enfeebled 1
            * 2 - Fort Save, Drained 1
            * 3 - Fort Save, Clumsy 1

    * **Creatures:** Elite [Hound of Tindalos](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=702) (4)

    * [Hasari](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/7PXjoR1V)

    * **Treasure:** [Oathbow](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=392)
    * For 5 players give the Tallow Ooze the elite adjustment and add a [Wand of Overflowing Life](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=756) (4th)
* **B9. Centrifuge (Low 11)**
    * Luonim the Vast (Use [Stirvyn Banyan](https://pf2.easytool.es/index.php?id=6614&name=stirvyn_banyan))
        * Remove the Dangerous Sorcery ability and instead give him the following abilities
        * **Blood Pool** (Free Action) **Requirements** you are not currently suffering persistent bleed damage **Effect** Increase the damage of a damaging spell by 2 points/spell level, but you take 1 point of bleed damage/spell level and must make a fortitude save vs. your own spell DC.
            * **Critical Success** no effect
            * **Success** 1d6 persistent bleed
            * **Failure** 2d6 persistent bleed
            * **Critical Failure **4d6 persistent bleed
        * **Hemophilia** The flat check to recover from bleed effects is increased by 2.
    * **Hazard:** The room starts or stops spinning when the lever is pulled as an interact action.  Anyone outside the center of the room has a +25 [shove](http://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=38) against them at the beginning of each of their turns, and moving towards the center of the room counts as difficult terrain. Jumping through an exit requires a DC33 basic reflex save or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage. On a failure the character becomes prone and stays on the same side of the door.
    * **Treasure:** [Wand of Teeming Ghosts](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=795) (4th), Scroll of [Shadow Walk](http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=275), [Bracers of Armor](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=416) I, [Flaying Knife](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=787)

* **B10. Moongarden (Trivial 11)**
    * Elite [Moonflower](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=730) (2)
    * For 5 players use 2 [Counteflora](http://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=518)
* **B11. Sun Room (Trivial 11)**
    * [Advanced Lurker in Light](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/qZFrrj8R-advanced-lurker-in-light) (3)
    * For 5 players add 1 more Lurker in Light
* **B12. Drowning Chamber (Moderate 11)**
    * Hummelgau ([Advanced Grodair](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/Ho6Xr57x-advanced-grodair))
        * Hummelgrau is unable to use his jaws from inside the cage, but can use his tentacle or water jet attacks
        * Attacks 
    * **Hazard:** Shocking Pool Trap
        * The pool acts on Hummelgrau’s turn
        * When initiative is rolled the pool begins to fill and the room becomes difficult terrain.
        * After the first turn the room is half way full and requires swim checks.  After the second turn the room is totally full and characters must hold their breath.
        * Killing Hummelgrau or removing his cap causes the water to empty over the course of 1 round.  Treat the cap as a wielded item for the purpose of disarm checks. If Hummelgrau is grabbed only a successful disarm is required rather than a critical success to remove the cap.
        * The room has 3 electricity runes spread evenly around the room that electrify each round dealing 4d12 electricity damage (Basic reflex) to everyone in the room as long as the water level is raised.  A DC32 (expert) Thievery, Arcana or Nature can disable a rune.  Disabling the first 2 runes reduces the damage by 1d12 each, while disabling the 3rd removes the damage completely.
    * For 5 players give Hummelgrau the elite adjustment.
* **B13. Rune Door (Moderate 11)**
    * [Silasni](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/598RXpvl)
        * **Development: _Silasni isn’t foolish enough to provoke a fight with a full party of adventurers. She has been studying the door and has figured out the ritual (below). She isn’t looking for allies, but knows she will need the help of others to be able to complete the ritual. When the party shows up she asks the ‘reinforcements’ to help her open the door while using mind reading to get a feeling for what they’re thinking. If they agree, once the ritual is complete, she steps through the door and immediately closes it before the rest of the party can make it through (Roll deception vs. the perception DC to see if the party is able to react)._**
    * **Hazard:** Rune Door
        * The Rune Door requires a level 6 (level 5 if primary is using arcana) ritual to open. The steps of this ritual can be discovered with a full day of study and a DC28 Arcana Check or by watching the ritual and a DC26 Arcana Check.
        * **Cast **1 minute; **Cost **none; **Secondary Casters** 2
        * **Primary Check** Arcana (expert), Occultism (master), Religion (master) or Nature (master); **Secondary Checks** Arcana, Occultism, Religion or Nature
        * To open the door requires 6 symbols to be lit and the ritual must be performed continuously or all the symbols go dark.
            * **Critical Success **3 of the symbols are lit.
            * **Success **2 of the symbols are lit.
            * **Failure** The door fires an arc of lightning dealing 6d12 electricity damage to the primary caster and 4d12 to each secondary caster with a DC28 basic reflex save.
            * **Critical Failure** As failure, but 1 of the lit symbols also goes dark

    * Weak [Piscodaemon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=592) (2)
    * **Development:** _The Thanadaemon stands on the bridge and if the party approaches him or the river he speaks to them telepathically. He explains that he is willing to let those who give up something of great value pass. His preferred currency is a piece of soul (permanent drained 1 which can only be regained by recovering the piece of their soul on a character who chooses to do this), but he will also accept items that are worth at least 400 gp from each character, silently shaking his head if an offered item is not valuable enough. He requires a second “donation” of at least 200 gp to allow someone to take a vial of river water. If anyone takes a hostile action against him or approaches within 10 feet of the bridge without agreeing to his terms he telepathically alerts the Piscodaemons swimming in the river and attacks.
    If Silasni makes it here she attempts to turn invisible and sneak past the Thanadaemon and is killed and turned into a soul gem. When the PCs arrive they can see her dessicated corpse lying at the base of the bridge._

    * For 5 players remove the weak adjustment from the Piscodaemons.
