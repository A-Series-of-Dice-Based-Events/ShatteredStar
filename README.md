# Shattered Star

[A Series of Dice-Based Events Discord](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H)

A repository to hold tools for those wishing to run and convert Shattered Star to Pathfinder 2.
The README.md files can have simple breakdowns of modified DCs for various tasks brought up in the Adventure while the individual folders can hold the files for the monster/NPC stat blocks.

Since Pathfinder 2 is much more friendly to high level play this adventure is currently being converted to cover the full 1 - 20 leveling range. Since some may wish to eventually convert this adventure using the default leveling range the conversion status is broken into two parts with separate status indicators for both the original and expanded level range.

:white_large_square: - Conversion is partially or wholely incomplete.
:white_check_mark: - Conversion is "playably" complete. All (or at least the majority) of monsters and important items have been converted to PF2 equivalents. Any unique monsters or items are available in a publicly accessible format. The conversion may need an editing pass, may be missing some less important features (xp tables, treasure summaries, basic DCs etc.) and may link to outside websites or repositories for unique monsters, items, etc. Total XP/level and treasure/level may not be balanced.
:ballot_box_with_check: - Conversion is complete. The conversion has received an editing pass. All monsters and items are either linked on [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/) or are stored in this repository (as a json, image, etc.). "Nice to have" features like XP tables and treasure summaries are included. Total treasure and XP rewards should be similar to published adventures.

## How does this even work?

[What is Github?](https://youtu.be/U1C0F-Au9h4)
On GitHub, you can share text files (usually code) and collaborate with others. The nice thing is that README.md files display as you're browsing the folders of a GitHub Project using [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Making Changes

This tutorial should be applicable to any of the AP repositories out there.<br/>
There's an in browser editor that makes it easy to change the files you see and submit a request to have them permanently changed.
Just click into the file you want to change and select the edit button in the top right.
![editor icon on GitHub](https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/RiseOfTheRunelords/blob/master/Tutorial/ClickEditOnReadmePage.png)
After changing, there will be a button at the bottom of the browser editor to "Propose file change", feel free to include a message on why it was changed.

![submit changes](https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/RiseOfTheRunelords/blob/master/Tutorial/ProposeFileChange.png)
After clicking that button, it will show you the changes you've made and have a new button near the top of the page to "Create pull request". 
![create a pull request](https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/RiseOfTheRunelords/blob/master/Tutorial/CreatePR.png)
![open pull request](https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/RiseOfTheRunelords/blob/master/Tutorial/OpenPR.png)
This sends the changes in to become permanent record in the repository.
![submitted pull request](https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/RiseOfTheRunelords/blob/master/Tutorial/PR-submitted.png)
Now you can comment on the changes and discuss with others that change before it's solidified.
![comments section](https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/RiseOfTheRunelords/blob/master/Tutorial/CommentsOnPR.png)
Members can now approve your changes. 
![where PRs go](https://github.com/A-Series-of-Dice-Based-Events/RiseOfTheRunelords/blob/master/Tutorial/WherePRsGo.png)
Once you're added as a member, you can approve changes as well but all the changes are tracked so if we make a mistake, we can refer back to the old version. (just ask @mirkorainer on GitHub or in the [A Series of Dice-Based Events Discord](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H))

## Recommended Tool

http://monster.pf2.tools/ uses JSON files that can be easily imported/exported. This repository ideally will hold those files publicly sourced and created, as well as other tools/files. 
Please do not submit PDF files or entire texts of the AP. Only submit modifications for the DC and NPCs/Monsters. Please also include a page number/map section label so GMs can cross-reference.
