# Beyond the Doomsday Door

_This is a conversion of the Adventure Path Beyond the Doomsday Door (Shattered Star Book 3) to Pathfinder 2nd edition.  This is intended to be a conversion from the original adventure meant for 4 players.  Since I am running this for 5 players I will also note potential additions for 5 players._
_Expected level up points are noted and threat level of encounters are relative to those expected levels.  However, I use milestone leveling, so specific XP values are not given._
_Since I am already converting the entire adventure path I am trying to make it cover the entire leveling range from 1-20. For this module, that means that it will be covering levels 13-15, with the characters just entering level 16 at the completion of the module._
_In addition to the adventure path itself I will be adding “Additions” that are intended to enhance the adventure path.  These conversions will be kept in separate documents so that this conversion is faithful to the original adventure, but the places where I would add the content is noted._
_Note, since the characters are now several levels above where they were in the original adventure we will often have to increase the levels of the creatures in the adventure. Rather than list the full stats for these creatures I will list these as Advanced 'creature' (Level x) where x is the level the creature has been increased to. You can use a digital tool to advance the stats and abilities of these creatures, or reference the creature building benchmarks in the game mastery guide to figure out what the new creature stats should be._

## Level 13

#### Addition 14: PFS 4-26 The Waking Rune

_In this final addition we get to the conclusion to the Cult of Lissala story arc. The pathfinders take on Krune, the Runelord of Sloth to prevent him from returning to Varisia. Conversion is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AN0HfrXwfCqnSXyaoiXWPkPHxTKhg6iNkJNTtSzRTv8/)._

_**Treasure:** Moderate [Potion of Resistance](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=192) (1/character), Greater [Healing Potion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=186) (1/character), +2 Greater Striking Adamantine Flail, [Staff of Healing](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=357) (Major), +2 striking rapier (2), +1 resilient leather armor (2), [Staff of Conjuration](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=352) (Major)_

### Part One: News of Destruction

Sheila gives the party an Advanced Dusty Rose Prism [Aeon Stone](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=407). This functions the same as a standard version of the stone, but the shield cantrip scales with the level of the wielder. 

#### Pilla the Peddler

A DC 20 Recall Knowledge Nature can identify the redcap's cap. A critical success tells the players that these redcaps are larger and more dangerous than normal.

## Level 14

### Part Three: Down to Doomsday

_Note: Since some groups may or may not have Koriah with them the difficulty of these areas does not take her into account._

#### Dungeon Level 1

_Since each of the encounters in this area has the potential to spill into each other I made the threat levels of each room low. For the most part the creatures on this floor are intelligent and should try to gang up on the party and harrass them if they try to rest here._

* **B1. Spirits Cellar (Low 14)**
  * [Pallid Path Cultists](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/Pr2dQ6tc-pallid-path-cultist) (6)
  * The broken equipment in this room is a barrier to both movement and attacks. Treat the entire room as difficult terrain, and creatures have cover from anything not adjacent to themselves.
  * The Cultists will flee to **B4** if half of their number are defeated.
  * **Treasure:** +2 striking composite shortbow (1/cultist), +1 striking shortsword (1/cultist), [Storm Arrows](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=169) (3/cultist), 100gp of assorted treasure/cultist
  * For 5 players add 2 more cultists

* **B2. Brewery (Trivial 14)**
  * Elite [Clockwork Assassin](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1004)
  * **Treasure:** A +2 Greater Striking Rapier and Major [Ablative Armor Plating](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1102) can be salvaged from the assassin with a DC35 crafting check. It the rapier has the broken condition on a success, but not on a critical success. On a critical failure the armor plating is lost.
  * If lured to **B1** the Clockwork Assassin treats every creature as hostile. The cultists are aware of its capabilities and will try to stay away from it so that it will attack the pathfinders instead. B1 and B2 together are a Moderate encounter.

* **B4. Litany Room**
  * [Pallid Path Cultists](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/Pr2dQ6tc-pallid-path-cultist) (6)
  * **Treasure:** +2 striking composite shortbow (1/cultist), +1 striking shortsword (1/cultist), [Storm Arrows](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=169) (3/cultist), 100gp of assorted treasure/cultist
  * For 5 players add 2 more cultists

* **B5. Observation Room**
  * DC20 Religion to recognize the globe as a depection of Groetus. A critical success gives more information.

* **B6. Ice Room (Low 14)**
  * Advanced [Ice Golems](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=683) (Level 10)
  * The door to this room requires a DC30 Athletics check to open. On a success the door opens, but the character must immediately roll for the slippery ground. On a critical success the character opens the door without issue.
  * The extreme cold deals 5d6 cold damage (basic fortitude save) each round.
  * The ground is slippery; after each stride make a DC30 acrobatics check, moving at half speed or less gives a +4 to this roll
    * **Critical Failure** Fall prone and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage, slide an additional 1d4 * 5 feet in the direction you were moving.
    * **Failure** Fall prone
    * **Success** You are unsteady, take a -2 penalty to all attack rolls and skill checks that require movement until the start of your next turn.
    * **Crutical Success** No effect
  * For 5 players advance the Ice Golems to level 11.

* **B9. Workshop**
  * A DC30 Arcana check reveals the purpose of this room.
  * **Treasure:** [Ring of Maniacal Devices](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=457), [Traveler's Any-Tool](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=268), Golem crafting notes worth 1000gp.

* **B10. Common Room (Trivial 14)**
  * [Pallid Path Cultists](https://monster.pf2.tools/v/Pr2dQ6tc-pallid-path-cultist) (4)
  * **Treasure:** +2 striking composite shortbow (1/cultist), +1 striking shortsword (1/cultist), [Storm Arrows](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=169) (3/cultist), 100gp of assorted treasure/cultist
  * For 5 players add 1 more cultist

* **B12. Cloakroom (Low 14)**
  * Ikoradmus (Advanced [Taiga Giant](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=680) (Level 15))
  * **Treasure:** +2 Greater Striking Longspear, Fine red cloak worth 100gp, [Medusa Armor](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=603), [Brilliant Rapier](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1237), 1000gp in various treasure.
  * For 5 players advance Ikoradmus to level 16 and add a [Viper's Fang](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=238) talisman

#### Dungeon Level 2
* **C2. Temple of the Windsong (Low 14)**
  * Elite [Chernobue](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=775) (2)
  * **Treasure:** A DC35 perception check reveals the cache. Reduce this to DC25 if Casamir told the party about it or Koriah is with them. The cache contains 1 wand of [Restoration](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=258) (Level 6), 1 scroll of [Wind Walk](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=376), and 1 scroll of [Remove Curse](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=250) (Level 7)
  * For 5 players add a [Chernobue](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=775) (regular) and 1 [Panacea](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=188)
  * _A note on Chernobues; any party that is strong enough to face a Chernobue almost certainly has 1 or more party members with a light cantrip cast at 5th level or higher making the Chernobue's darkness spell useless and dealing extra damage to it each round. This seems dumb, so I recommend having some house rules for at least how this encounter works, if not for how the darkness spell works in general. I intentionally put the Brilliant Rapier in **B12** so that a party would have something other than a light spell available to counteract darkness._

* **C3. Temple of Sunset**
  * Invaders must make a DC35 will save to enter this room. A failure prevents an invader from entering for an hour while a critical failure prevents them from entering until the following day.
  * Double any non magical healing in this room.

* **C4. Acolytes' Lodgings (Trivial 14)**
  * Elite [Wearbears](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=412) (4)
  * Advanced [Shoggti](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=773) (Level 11) (2)
  * **Treasure:** 7 [Explosive Bolts](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=162)
  * For 5 players add 2 more Wearbears, advance the Shoggti to level 12, and 3 more Explosive Bolts

* **C5. Green Mouse Fountain (Moderate 14)**
  * **Hazard:** [Summoning Rune](https://2e.aonprd.com/Hazards.aspx?ID=20) (Level 16) that summons an [Elemental Vessel, Water](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1009)
  * If the summoning rune is tripped the area begins filling with water. After 2 rounds the entire area is difficult terrain.

* **C6. Prophecy Room**
  * **Treasure:** A DC35 Religion check can determine the function of the parchments. Once per day the parchment can be used to cast [Read Omens](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=247).

* **C7. Shrine of Empty Places (Low 14)**
  * Elite [Augnagar](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=776)
  * *Note: When combined with **C8** this is a severe encounter*

* **C8. Hall of Ruin (Low 14)**
  * Elite [Augnagar](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=776)
  * *Note: When combined with **C7** this is a severe encounter*

* **C9. Apothecarium**
  * **Treasure:** [Philosopher's Stone](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=133), Greater [Alchemist Goggles](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=408), formulas for Greater [Stone Body Mutagen](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=475) and [Lifeblight Residue](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=831)
  * *Note: Unlike in 1e the Philosopher's Stone isn't easily usable by characters under level 20. Although it doesn't have a listed value, it should be worth ~7000gp if the players want to sell it.*

  * **Hazard:** Tentacle +25, 2d8+10 bludgeoning + grab, athletics +25. Use Ardathanatus' initiative for simplicity. For grabbed creatures constrict 5d8, DC35 and move 5 feet towards the portal on a failure, 10 feet on a critical failure. Unconscious creatures are pulled twice as far. Any creature pulled into the portal is driven insane/ripped apart by Yamasoth and is effectively lost forever.
  * **Development:** At the beginning of combat Ardathanatus uses 1 of his actions to continue the ritual and the other two to cast defensive or buffing spells. During this time the hazard attacks 1 of the two 10 foot wide sections outside of the pillars in the room out to 60 feet from the portal (10 feet from the door). All creatures in this room attempt to stay between the pillars to avoid this. If Ardathanatus is engaged in melee or takes significant damage he focuses on the intruders instead of the ritual. Once this happens the tentacles instead attack all creatures within 2 of the 4 10 foot wide spans in this room at random out to 60 feet from the portal. If Ardathanatus is incapacitated the doors in the room swing open for two rounds. Immediately, and on Ardathanatus' initiative each round every creature in the room is subject to a level 10 DC33 [Baleful Polymorph](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=17) and the tentacles attack every creature within 60 feet of the door, although they do not try to grab or constrict any creature that has been Baleful Polymophed. At the end of the second round any creatures that are grabbed and within 15 feet of portal is pulled through as the doors slam shut.
  * **Treasure:** +3 Greater Striking Greater Fearsome Halberd, +2 resilient Full Plate (or dragon plate from **D12**), [Shard of Envy](https://template.pf2.tools/v/QvDmWYdL-shard-of-envy), if Ardathanatus survives and is set down a better path he can teach the party the following uncommon spells: [Consecrate Flesh](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1110), [Blackfinger's Blades](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1076), [Dimensional Lock](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=71), and [Ethereal Jaunt](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=105)
  * For 5 players remove the weak adjustment from Ardithanatus and the Wrathspawn
